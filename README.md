# Course Assignment for JS2
This is a Course Assignment for JavaScript 2. 

## Goal 
To apply knowledge of JavaScript techniques to implement the front end functionality for a social media application

## Brief
You have been tasked with producing a new JavaScript front end client for an existing social media platform. The client application must be attractive and responsive, but you have an otherwise blank slate in terms of theme design language.

Using the provided API and API documentation, create a functioning user interface that allows for ***viewing, posting, editing and deleting*** social media content.

Social API routes require authorization via JWT (JSON Web Tokens). You will need to register an account and login to access your token.

In order to complete the required features you will also need to make use of ```GET```, ```POST```, ```PUT```, and ```DELETE``` HTTP methods.

Using localStorage is *highly recommended*, especially for storing JWT tokens.

A finished project fulfills the requirements below with an easy to use and error-free user interface
